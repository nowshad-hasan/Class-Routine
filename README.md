# Class Routine
Class routine is a project made for SUST CSE Department. The main goal of this project was to manage the daily classes of students and teachers. Like - when new semester starts with new routine with their teachers and students and class room, the routine be assigned to the corresponding teachers, students and class rooms. And then default reminder will be set for every teachers and students about their upcoming class schedules. If any change is happened for a particular class, then all students of the class will be push notified about the change. And other teachers will be also notified about it so that they can arrange a new scedule over the latest change. Any user of this system like - student or teacher can see their today's or next day's schedules from mobile app. Teacher can add/edit/delete the default schedules from the app and others will be notified. The changes can be permanent or temporary.
